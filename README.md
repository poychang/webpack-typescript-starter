# Webpack TypeScript Starter

This is the simplest possible setup to get you started with Webpack 4 and TypeScript. You can then start from here and add further stuff you need, such as SASS compilation, add framework specific stuff etc.

Also check out the official Webpack 4 docs for a proper TypeScript setup: https://webpack.js.org/guides/typescript/
